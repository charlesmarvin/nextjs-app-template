This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) but updated with some standards I like using for new projects.

The intent is that this repo be forked when starting new projects.

This repo was based on this [tutorial](https://github.com/alexeagleson/nextjs-fullstack-app-template)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Storybook development

This project uses Storybook. Run story book using the below command:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

Open [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006/)
